// nothing. Fork-safety comes from (a) GitHub never granting a
// pull_request-triggered workflow repo secrets, (b)
// strict_required_status_checks_policy forcing the PR branch to be
// up-to-date with main and every listed check green on that exact
// commit, and (c) non_fast_forward + deletion blocking history rewrites on
// main itself. The bypass list is deliberately empty: trusted agents satisfy
// policy; they do not bypass it.
